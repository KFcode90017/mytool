launcher: do not touch VT/tty while using non-default seat

Launcher-direct does not allow us to run using a different
seat from the default seat0. This happens because VTs are
only exposed to the default seat, and users that are on
non-default seat should not touch VTs.

Add check in launcher-direct to skip VT/tty management if user
is running on a non-default seat.
